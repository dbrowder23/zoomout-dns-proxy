# ZoomOut DNS Proxy â€” Architecture Overview

## Project Purpose

ZoomOut DNS Proxy dynamically intercepts DNS traffic on localhost, blocking telemetry and tracking domains used by Zoom and related applications. It protects user privacy by refusing to resolve known surveillance domains, while allowing normal traffic to flow seamlessly.

---

## System Components

### 1. DNS Interceptor (`DnsProxy`)
- Listens on `127.0.0.1:53` for all local DNS queries.
- Parses each incoming DNS query packet.
- Checks if the domain matches a **blacklist**.
  - If matched: immediately responds with `127.0.0.1`.
  - If not matched: transparently forwards query to upstream DNS (default: `8.8.8.8`).

### 2. Blacklist Management (`config.rs`)
- Maintains a list of telemetry and tracking domains.
- Domains are **Base64-encoded** inside `blacklist.txt` to deter casual inspection.
- On startup:
  - Loads and decodes entries into memory.
- During runtime:
  - Detects new suspicious domains (pattern matching) and automatically Base64-encodes them into the blacklist file.

### 3. Logging (`utils.rs`)
- Provides basic logging to console using `env_logger`.
- Captures blocked domains, forwarded domains, and new detections.
